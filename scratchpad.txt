Having trouble installing gruff, which I want for graphs.

gem install gruff has trouble with rmagick, trying to install image magic manually
sudo apt-get install imagemagick libmagickwand-dev

that worked. 

so sudo apt-get install imagemagick libmagickwand-dev;gem install rmagick; gem install gruff

rbm gemset use school 

that uses the school gemset which includes this.

git add [file to add]

git commit -a -m "whatever we did"

git push remote master
